## Research interests
My current research interests are centered on analogy and the challenges of representation learning, from the axis of deep learning.

Analogical reasoning (AR) and analogical proportions, which are the topic of my Ph.D., are full of potential to capture a key mechanism of human reasoning capability. AR allows to reason and transfer knowledge within and across domains, in a similar manner as case-based reasoning. A key advantage of AR is the ease of interpretation: the mechanism itself is intuitive, and allows for examples and counterexamples to be found.
