## Research interests
My current research interests are centered on analogy and the challenges of representation learning.

Analogical reasoning and analogical proportions, which are the topic of my Ph.D., are full of potential to capture a key mecanism of human reasoning capability [[1]](some bib reference here).
Analogical reasoning allows to reason and transfer
